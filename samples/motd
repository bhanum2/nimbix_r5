All ML/DL frameworks live in /opt/DL; you must source an environment setup
script before accessing them, e.g. one of the following:

	source /opt/DL/caffe-bvlc/bin/caffe-activate
	source /opt/DL/caffe-ibm/bin/caffe-activate
	source /opt/DL/caffe-nv/bin/caffe-activate	# recommended
	source /opt/DL/chainer/bin/chainer-activate
	source /opt/DL/openblas/bin/openblas-activate
	source /opt/DL/tensorflow/bin/tensorflow-activate
	source /opt/DL/theano/bin/theano-activate
	source /opt/DL/torch/bin/torch-activate

After sourcing the environment script for the framework you wish to use,
please read the framework-specific documentation in its respective doc[s]
directory - e.g. one of the following:

	/opt/DL/caffe-*/docs
	/opt/DL/chainer/doc
	/opt/DL/openblas/doc
	/opt/DL/repo/doc
	/opt/DL/tensorflow/doc
	/opt/DL/theano/doc
	/opt/DL/torch/doc

Files created or updated in folders other than /data will be lost on container restore.

After you have completed the demos, feel free to use the container to explore the capabilities of PowerAI. 
If you have completed the demonstration, please help conserve resources by canceling the subscription used 
to create this instance.  
Thank you.
